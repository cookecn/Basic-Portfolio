                    Hello! My name is Colby Cooke and I am learning how to code! I hail from the 
                    great state of Virginia, in a small town named Goochland. It was so small that
                    we only had one stop-light in the entire town! There were sports, and clubs, but 
                    most importantly there were friendships. Everyone knew everyone, literally. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    After I graduated from Goochland High School I attended Vanderbilt University and
                    played collegiate football. During college I learned a lot about who I was and wanted
                    to become. Now i'm here, doing what I want to do. Now you know a little bit about me!
